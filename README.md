# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the requirement analysis documentation for a booking management system project. It serves as a comprehensive blueprint that outlines functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria for the system development.

The documentation follows industry-standard practices for software requirement specification and provides a solid foundation for the subsequent development phases of the booking management system.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and constraints that a software system must satisfy. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent development activities and ensures that the final product aligns with business objectives and user expectations.

### Importance in SDLC

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the SDLC for several reasons:

1. **Foundation for Development**: Provides the blueprint that guides all design, implementation, and testing activities
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Helps identify potential issues and contradictions early in the process
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces rework and changes during later stages by establishing clear requirements upfront
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensures all parties (clients, users, developers) share a common understanding of the system
5. **Quality Assurance**: Forms the basis for test cases and acceptance criteria
6. **Scope Management**: Helps prevent scope creep by clearly defining project boundaries

The process typically involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, analyzing them for completeness and consistency, prioritizing needs, and documenting them in a clear, unambiguous manner that can be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.
